# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
**Purpose**:
To learn how to take some exisiting code and refactor it to make it more accessible for people with disabilities. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 
This can help business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
